Evaluating measurement uncertainty in frequency-domain figures-of-merit for nonlinear microwave amplifiers
==
Nonlinear amplifiers are widely today used in many communications applications from cellular to WiFi. Their ability to achieve efficiencies above the linear limit of 50% makes them well suited to personal devices such as mobile phones, where battery power sources are a considerable limitation. In order to achieve the best possible performance from these systems, accurate measurements of the amplifier are required to characterize it for use in the design process. The inclusion of measurement uncertainty in this characterization, which is not currently present, provides a level of confidence in the measurement and can help to isolate model discrepancies from measurement error. In this paper, we present a first attempt at propagating measurement uncertainty to wave parameters of nonlinear amplifiers, and then propagate these uncertainties to useful frequency-domain figures-of-merit such as gain, input match, and power-added-efficiency.

This is essentially a realisation of the paper idea we had last year, but I couldn't do the full evaluation until we had the comb generator characterization as that problem is upstream of the X-Parameter extraction and therefore affected both papers.
I don't see any publications since which have looked at frequency domain FOMs. The new Leuven PCE paper (http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7934068/) covers Angleov model terms and time domain waveforms.

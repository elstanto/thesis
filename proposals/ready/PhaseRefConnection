The effect of connection configuration of harmonic phase references on the precision of NVNA measurements?
==
Nonlinear vector network analysers (NVNAs) are widely used to characterise nonlinear microwave devices, for example power amplifiers.
For the more common mixer based variant, based on a heterodyne architecture, a stable phase reference is required to normalize so called "cross-frequency" harmonic measurements.
The absolute response of the reference is not required to be known, however it must remain very stable throughout measurements of all harmonics.
This paper investigates the effect on the total measurement uncertainty of a nonlinear power amplifier from different connection configurations of the reference.

Myself and Martin's suspicion is that we might see thermal effects from a direct connection of the very hot
67 GHz reference. We think over time that the temparture may conduct into the VNA test port and cause some drift.
Even if this is not the case, we would like to compare the effect from using a couple of typical cables (phase stable and cheaper ones)
in order to show the uncertainty contributions to actual measurements of an amplifier. These could be just nonlinear waves or also X-Parameters.

Temperature dependent X-Parameter measurments including uncertainties
==
This idea depends on the impact of the temperature-dependent X-Parameter work led by
Sean and Peter. My contribution is measurement uncertainty, which should be similar to
the existing analysis I have done. We can also add the uncertianty contribution from the
temperature measurements (thermocouple), and could then provide XY error bars on parameter vs temperature plots.

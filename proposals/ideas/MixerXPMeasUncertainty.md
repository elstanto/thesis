X-Parameter mixer models including measurement uncertainty
==
Not quite sure how to write the abstract for this one, as I haven't done much with mixers.
We can measure them with our setup at the ATI, perform a 3-port calibration with the MUF,
and extract X-Parameters on the PNA-X. This is very similar to the amplifier measurements and
shouldn't present any additional challenges. As we do not need to use external couplers we could
do mm-wave mixer, or a microwave mixer with many harmonics.

This work would potentially need a mixer purchasing if there was not one already available.

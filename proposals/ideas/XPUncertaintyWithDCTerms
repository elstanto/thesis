X-Parameter amplifier measurements with uncertainty including DC terms
==
This paper is an extension of the main transactions measurement uncertainty paper but
includes DC bias terms and uncertainty in them. This would require modifying the MUF
to process DC terms (possible, and should be fairly straightforward), and also measuring
an amplifier which does not including internal bias regulation (e.g. the MET5G Marki amplifier
or another device, maybe on-wafer).

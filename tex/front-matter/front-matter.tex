\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to thank my supervisory team: Peter Aaen, Nick Ridler and Marian Florescu. Peter and Nick gave me many opportunities throughout the project and were especially helpful and encouraging when problems arose. Marian took over as my primary supervisor while writing this dissertation and offered great advice and support to help me complete my work.

Martin Salter at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), Teddington, who learned about nonlinear behavioural models and their extraction alongside me, always provided fruitful discussions and these helped me a great deal in my understanding of the science and mathematics. Martin also assisted with or performed some of the measurements in our publications.

I would also like to thank Daniel Stokes and other scientists in the electromagnetic measurements labs at NPL, who provided training and access to use their equipment, including the National primary standards for impedance in a variety of coaxial and waveguide media. Their welcoming and friendly nature also made every trip to NPL interesting, even when the schedule consisted entirely of repeated measurements!

I must extend huge thanks to Dylan Williams and his group at the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) in Boulder, CO, USA. When I made contact with Dylan in regards to extending his existing software uncertainty framework he was immediately helpful and encouraging. He extended his upcoming UK trip to European Microwave Week and stayed at the university for an additional week to work with me expanding his software. The following year he invited me to visit NIST for three weeks to spend more time integrating behavioural model extraction into his software, and to characterise phase references used in my experiments. Both Dylan and his colleagues were excellent hosts and it was really exciting to work in an office with so much knowledge and experience. Special thanks also to Gustavo Avolio who performed the characterisation of our phase references, and also reviewed my final publication.

Away from my desk, my mother has provided me with a lot of support during my studies and put up with my various complaints. She has never stopped believing that I could finish my project and must feel quite vindicated now!

I am enormously grateful to my colleague and friend throughout my entire university career, Sean Gillespie. Together we were Peter's first PhD students at the University of Surrey, and experienced all the ups and downs of starting a new lab. We saw the university change a lot over the previous nine years, and I'm sure we will both look back in future with very fond memories of it.

Finally, last but not least, I would like to thank my fellow students and staff at the Advanced Technology Institute at the University of Surrey: Haris, Gemma, Jonas, Morgan, Steve, Matei, Tony, John, Grace, Julian, Jose, Kostis, Scott, James, Bob - the list goes on. Together they made my time as a postgraduate thoroughly enjoyable and I will miss them all!

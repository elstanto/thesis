The second order products, and upper third order products, can be easily filtered out. However, the lower third order products $2f_1-f_2$ and $2f_2-f_1$ are located within the channel bandwidth and interact with the useful data, increasing EVM and BER \cite {Hall2013}.}}{11}

The reflected wave, $b_1$, is also sampled by another directional coupler and sent to the test receiver as $b_1{REF}$, with the remaining power dissipated at the matched source.}}{12}

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.6}{\ignorespaces A modern two-source mixer-based VNA, which employs heterodyning to allow measurements at microwave frequencies. Two directional couplers are located between each source and the DUT and are connected back to back. These sample waves travelling in both directions and are connected to mixers which downconvert the microwave frequencies (R) into intermediate frequencies (I) which can be sampled by the complex receivers. The shared local oscillator (LO) feeding the mixers preserves phase coherence between the receivers. This configuration is known as a two-port double-reflectometer VNA.

These extra terms account for different error values when the incident signal is sourced from each port. Additionally for the two-port case, a transmission term $E_{TN}$ has been added for each direction.}}{16}
